# matlab-battleship
 Using MATLAB, me and my group created a pretty complex (but simple?) battleship game, complete with single player and 2-player mode. For the best results, download this code and run it on MATLAB's code editor and use the "command window" to play the game. All the instructions and commands are listed in detail there. Have fun!
